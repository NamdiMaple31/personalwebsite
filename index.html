        Who The Heck is Namdi???
    </h2>
    <p class="namdi_family">
        What's up my name is Namdi Nesta Maple. Born on September 12, 2002,
        I am a fifteen year old African-American male with big plans.
        I live with my mother, my father, and my two siblings. My grandparents
        on my mothers side play a big part in my life to the point that they are almost
        like a second set of parents. My grandparents on my fathers side are around too,
        but they live far and I don't see them as often. My family owns a children's education center
        that was founded by my grandparents back in the year 1992. My family is well known throughout my
    community for their hardwork and business endeavors. Seriously I can't go anywhere with them without 
them seeing someone they know. They have quite the history! Needless to say my family has done an excellent
job paving the way for my siblings and I and I firmly believe that what ever happens in the future I will be successful
and content with my life.  </p>

            Well, if you must know I consider myself to be a very creative person. I'm not some 
            tie-dye wearing hippie don't get me wrong, but I do possess very artistic hobbies such as
            writing, drawing, and such. I also enjoy computer science mainly game and webpage design. I'm
            not terribly experienced but I have fun with what I can do.
